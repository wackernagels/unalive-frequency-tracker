Before we didn't have many friends, it was just me and her, we would have our own separate friends but the jealous was too much so we kept our friends separate. I know that sounds horrible but it was going so well.\nShe is my bestfriend. i can tell her anything. We split up over something silly really, it was my own fault, i lied about a friend (of the opposite sex) being at my place. We were just playing cards and she was missing her boyfriend (he lives in a different country) so i kept her company. I would never think of cheating on her, it would never ever pop into my mind. But she asked me to come over but it was late and i was keeping said friend company and she would be leaving soon. Anyway, we basically playing cards on my bed and i took a picture of her, (she always just takes random pictures at random moments so i decided to show her how it feels and take one back). I go round to my girlfriends later that night and in the night while i was sleeping my girlfriend found that picture and woke me up and the rest of her flat (10 girls!) up. i ran home but i knew i would be back\nwe then split up, a month later i found some new friends and didn't hear from her in that time.\nOne day i got a call from my dad saying my Nan has bowl cancer. I know its not like she died but in my family (two divorced parents) all my grandparents are alive and well. I instantly broke down in tears and panicked. I had to talk to someone. So i rang up my exgirlfriend and asked to meet her straight away.\nWe met and she said i looked like shit, that i wasn't acting myself and shes never seen me so upset. She really cheered me up that day, i know i could have talked to my new friends but i didn't want to put that pressure on them because im the talkative one and makes everyone else happy, everyone knew something was up with me because i wasn't talking much.\nRight now im styping this in my home (mums house) and im utterly heartbroken. I keep thinking about my ex and i miss her so fucking much but we both know we're not good together. I just want to see her and hug her so tight like we used to. but i know its wrong.\nI just needed to tell someone that story, even if its just one person, im so heartbroken and sad, about my Nana, ex and my situation in life.\nI know i would never kill myself but there isn't really much to live for right now.\nJust the thought of someone laying their hands on my snug (ex) makes me so angry and im not like that, im a calm laid back person and i cant deal with it, it makes me want to die.\nPlease can someone just talk to me.""}, {'time': 'Mon Dec 29 2014 16:20:11 GMT-0600 (10 years ago)', 'unalivecount': 0, 'killcount': 2, 'title': 'My now-homeless sister, her addictions, her mental illness. Not sure how much longer I can do this.', 'text': '\nShe showed up in the city I live a few weeks ago. She has no money, she\'s pregnant, and seems to be abusing pills. She also lashes out at anyone who helps her.\nShe was addicted to heroin, got clean for a bit and got a job earlier this year. Her first real job (she\'s 27), but lost it after a few months. After that, she hung around our hometown living off money she got from suing a car insurance company over an accident she was involved in. This was tens of thousands of dollars, but she managed to spend it all this year.\nShe then decided to pack all her things up in her car and drive south with her boyfriend. This was someone she knew was bad news (a felon). He said they\'d have a place to stay, and he would get a job and support them. That plan fell through, so they kept driving. In the meantime, she got pregnant.\nEventually they got to the city where I live, and I got them a motel room so they wouldn\'t be sleeping in the car. While there, the boyfriend decided to use meth in the motel room, so my sister told him to leave and he did.\nThat just leaves her now. She\'s not well in any sense. She has trouble doing things like getting to the grocery store on her own. She goes through intense mood swings and talks about killing herself. She has a large bag of different kinds of prescription pills - I don\'t even know what she is taking, when, or how much. She\'s also smoking weed, and there\'s no way this combination is good for the baby.\nRight now I have her staying in a hotel room. I couldn\'t let her stay with me for multiple reasons – mostly, because of how unstable she is. I have my own emotional issues and having to be around her all the time would kill me.\nI spent a night overnight with her at the hotel room because she didn\'t want to be alone. At 4 AM, while on sleeping pills, she went out on the street and I had to drag her back in. She then spent the next couple hours sitting on my bed yelling at me angrily about how everything that\'s happened in her life is my fault/could have been prevented by me.\nEvery bad choice she makes, she has a defense that involves someone else. She didn\'t have an easy childhood – there were times when my father beat her and he still won\'t own up to it. But often when she talks, it all just sounds like delusions.\nI want to help her, but I don\'t know what I can do anymore and this is draining me emotionally and mentally. I can\'t leave her alone for a day, but many times I\'m with her she\'ll be horribly rude and spend the entire time (hours and hours) doing nothing but tell me how what she\'s going through is my fault. How I never stopped my father from hurting her, how I ""made"" her leave the father of her child, how I never got her help when she needed it (I tried and she made excuses).\nI really think she needs rehab or some kind of residential treatment, but she refuses. She won\'t even consider it – the closer I get to getting her to agree, the more excuses she finds. It would all be paid for, too – my parents are willing to pay for the entire cost.\nI never dreamed of having to be responsible for another person like this – a person older than me, at that – but now I am. And I really can\'t handle this.'}, {'time': 'Mon Dec 29 2014 15:51:47 GMT-0600 (10 years ago)', 'unalivecount': 0, 'killcount': 1, 'title': ""I love you, but you're driving me insane."", 'text': '\nI love you so much and I will stand by you to the very end, but you are driving me crazy.\nI can\'t stand how lazy you are.

I know your thyroid is a big part of it, but I don\'t understand why you\'re so pissy all the time at ME. I refuse to have another conversation with you, crying into my chest because you hate the way you look in the mirror. I\'ve paid for your gym membership for 2 YEARS, and you\'ve squandered it.

I\'m so tired of all the complaining, laziness and the anger. I want you to start helping out around the house, rather than doing laundry once a month and telling all our friends that I\'M the lazy one (seriously? you\'re going to tell Beth that my ""only job"" is taking out the garbage? oh yeah, i forgot: YOU do the dishes every night. YOU take the dog out to pee, YOU pick up after yourself). You have the nerve to get mad at ME when I\'m playing xbox while you\'re cleaning our bedroom? I do enough as it is, I deserve a little ""me"" time. What about every week when you\'re watching TV and I\'m doing the dishes and taking out the garbage? not to mention I take care of the dog you got, the one that I never wanted.\nUGH.\nAlso? Me playing video games is not a ""phase"" and I\'m not going to ""get out of it"". God forbid I sit down to play xbox with my friends after waking at 5AM nearly every morning, hitting the gym and then working until 6:30. You want to heckle me for that? What would you rather do?

I\'m going to be frank, he\'s emotionally and mentally unstable, and I think he\'s a danger to himself and the people around him. He\'s manipulative, throws pity parties for himself constantly, and he owns a copy of the anarchist\'s cookbook and a shitload of weapons to go with it. So we have this dangerous person, who has access to dangerous things and he is madly in love with me. How do I know? Because he would tell me all the time and thought I didn\'t want to date him because he was ""a nice guy"" and I only dated douchebags. He said every person I\'ve ever dated was a douche.He also made a habit of following me around and sitting next to me whenever possible. Why didn\'t I tell him to go fuck himself and go away? Because he made me feel guilty. He\'d ask if I wanted to hang out and I\'d say ""Oh no, I already have plans"" and he\'d either invite himself along with me or he\'d go on about how lonely he is. I almost felt obligated to keep him somewhat happy because he\'d kill himself otherwise. If he went over the line hitting on me it was always ""I was just trying to woo you over, maybe you\'ll love me someday!"" If I talked about another guy and he was around, he\'d tell me to stop talking about it because it ""triggered his anxiety"" I actually have an anxiety disorder, and he triggered it everyday without a fucking care in the world.He told me that I was faking my disorder for attention.\nI had a friend move away, and this guy stalking me got upset and said ""Why don\'t you just get over it? I had to get over you."" Mind you I was in the hallway before school bawling my eyes out and a whole group of people had to listen to him go on this manifesto about how I\'d never see this friend again anyways and he\'d probably just break contact while I was crying over my friend moving back to England. I had a boyfriend cheat on me, and stalker threatened to murder him. And he told my other friend ""When PrinceVile comes to school and she gets upset when I tell her the news, let me comfort her."" and I guess I didn\'t get upset in the way he wanted. I don\'t really ever cry when I\'m upset, I joke about it. I was like ""Oh well, I guess I\'ll just go write that douche\'s phone number on some shady bathroom stall or something."" and then he flipped. He was screaming at me that this was more painful for him than it was for me because ""I have to watch you date a bunch of assholes instead of me and I\'m a nice guy! They just all mistreat you and you\'re okay with it because you\'re fucking mental."" I wasn\'t allowed to speak about my boyfriend cheating on me while he was around either because he ""might snap and do something he\'d regret"" And then the end of the school year came and he kept calling me, texting me and I blocked him on everything. I went to a different high school, and he moved to a town an hour away from here.\nRecently(about 2 months ago), he has found my new phone number and he texted me, at first being upset that I didn\'t want to talk to him, and I explained that I was uncomfortable with him speaking to me and he suddenly got all apologetic and said ""I\'m sorry you were a victim of my behavior but, I just want to rekindle our friendship."" and I told him I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him and he said ""Okay, I\'ll stop talking to you, and I\'m sorry.""\nEven though it\'s over, I\'m still paranoid about him resurfacing or something. I always hear cases about people\'s stalkers giving up for a few years and coming back out of nowhere. I think the thing that\'s bothering me is he\'s seriously told me about wanting to murder people. It\'s been almost a year since I\'ve seen him and I\'m still scared shitless of him.\nTL;DR Mentally Unstable classmate stalks me, apologizes for it, I\'m still fucking scared of him.'}, {'time': 'Mon Dec 29 2014 11:02:00 GMT-0600 (10 years ago)', 'unalivecount': 0, 'killcount': 1, 'title': 'I hate Drunk Drivers', 'text': ""\nI know that it could have been so much worse, but you came out of nowhere and you messed up everything.

I'm in college, my little sister is in high school, and my little bro is about to start high school himself. It's painfully obvious that my little brother is mildly autistic. He has all the symptoms, significant problems with communication (slurred speech, awkward eye and hand motions), little to no friendships with kids his own age, a huge need to be alone, and expresses no interest in doing anything but little kid stuff like legos and video-games. He even had to go speech and hand writing therapy because teachers could not understand him. He hasn't changed in emotional maturity since I've known him, and seeing how kids his own age interact really highlights it. Personal grooming is seen as an afterthought, and he frequently walks around in dirty clothes and uncombed hair because he doesn't care. We try to make him change, but it doesn't last long.\nI'm not going to pretend I'm always the nicest guy to my brother. Its infuriating trying to talk with him, as he'll just change the subject to something random and kill the flow. But I have no idea HOW i'm supposed to act around him. I try to joke around like with my friends, but he doesn't understand and gets offended. I try to include him, but he losses interest and walks away. Leading to me just verbally abusing him when I get mad. I feel really bad, but I honestly do not know how to deal with him. My sister is the same way, but even worse because she is with him 24/7 as both my parents work.\nThe worst part is that my Mom is in complete denial about it, and refuses to even talk about his problems. Saying he is just like every other boy his age. Which is pretty funny coming from a lady who takes medication for clinical depression. I just finished fighting with her about it tonight, and it always ends the same. Her claiming that I'm jealous of how much love he gets, and I shouldn't take out my self hate on him (I see a lot of mistakes I made in him, and I keep trying to tell him the right way to do stuff). I do actually have a huge amount of self-hate, but I've reached the point where I don't even care anymore so its not a big deal. My little brother he is completely oblivious to all this. His moods just swing back and forth, and I don't even know what he feels about the situation. I don't even know him as a person! And it scares me. All I know is what he likes, not his views on things or even his personality. Just talking with him is like playing around with one of those old tape recorders. He just regurgitates random facts and events from the news and wanders away.\nSo I guess you could say this is a horrible place for him, but its really not. I rarely fight with my parents, and they have been nothing but loving providers since the day I could remember. I just feel that my brother is going to suffer in the long term due to all of us having no idea how to help him.\nedit. tl;dr Hella autistic little bro gets either no help or bad help""}, {'time': 'Sun Dec 28 2014 23:26:25 GMT-0600 (10 years ago)', 'unalivecount': 0, 'killcount': 4, 'title': 'I wish they just killed me.', 'text': '\n...

I used to jump to her whim whenever she said that (she was going to kill herself) but after hearing it so frequently and knowing she only said it to have things go her way I quit listening.\nRecently she came home from University because she is studying abroad (England) and is leaving in a few weeks. Our Mother has paid for everything she has ever had. K doesn\'t pay car insurance, for gas, her cell phone bill, NOTHING. A few days before Christmas she had the balls to call our mother a racist and start spouting off about ""white capitalist America"", which I find stupid seeing as my fiancé is mixed (mother is white, father is black).\nOur Mother had finally had enough of K\'s BS and finally snapped, she kicked her out and told her to pack her crap. I don\'t live with my Mom but I live relatively close, so K texted me and told me to pick her up or she was going to kill herself. I feel bad that I don\'t believe her anymore but I can\'t take it anymore. My sister is a spoiled brat who thinks she can shove her opinion down other people\'s throats but goes off the handle if anyone\'s opinion differs from hers. I can\'t stand it anymore. I didn\'t text her for Christmas nor do I plan on communicating with her anytime soon. I honestly can\'t wait for her to go to England. My Mom deserves a break from K\'s BS (Mom just finished her Masters degree and was stressed out as it was). I\'m sorry for the long post and the rant but I just couldn\'t take the stress K has caused us for many years. I\'m not perfect but I am at least a functioning member of society who cares about other people (especially those who care about me), my Mom deserves better than K.'}, {'time': 'Sun Dec 28 2014 18:46:01 GMT-0600 (10 years ago)', 'unalivecount': 0, 'killcount': 1, 'title': 'Something weird happened yesterday...', 'text': '\nI went to Subway yesterday with a friend and my dad. The moment I stepped in the door, I met eyes with a girl who was working there. She was about my age, maybe a little older (I\'m 17). When we met eyes I got...scared. I don\'t know how else to put it. It wasn\'t a scare like ""Oh shit this person is going to kill me"", but it was a scare I\'ve never experienced before. She smiled and I looked away. I want to know what happened because I don\'t understand it. I don\'t think it\'s love, but I have no idea.'}]}"
