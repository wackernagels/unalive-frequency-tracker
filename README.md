# FAQs
### Where are the datasets?
* The datasets are too big for GitHub! You can access them here:

### Why are you doing this?
* Prototyping and getting practice in for a bigger project!

### My IP address got blocked! What now?
* Find a proxy! I accessed mine from here: [https://free-proxy-list.net/](https://free-proxy-list.net/)

## How long will it take to scrape/preprocess the data?
* Each word may take up to eight hours to scrape. The preprocessing may take up to 12 hours! If you have access to multiple computers I would recommend running these scripts on a machine you don't often use.

### Can I use this code for other words/subreddits/etc?
* Yes! You can find instructions on querying with the PullPush Reddit API on their website: [https://pullpush.io/](https://pullpush.io/)

### Can I use this code for different websites?
* Yes! Be aware however that different websites have different HTML structures, so the scraping logic will need to be rewritten if you choose to use a different website!
